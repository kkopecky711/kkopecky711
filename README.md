## Kai Kopecky

I'm community ecologist and postdoctoral researcher. By training, I'm a marine field ecologist by training, having worked mostly in coral reef ecosystems. Now as a postdoc, I'm working on ecological data synthesis, in close association with the NSF Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network.
